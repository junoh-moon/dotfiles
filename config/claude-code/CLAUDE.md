- When you cannot implement the code immediately, explicitly indicate that it has not been implemented. For example, use `NotImplementedError` in Python or `TODO` in Kotlin. Do not hardcode to hide the problem.
- Create a todo list first when working on complex tasks to track progress and remain on track.

- For database access tasks (schema analysis, sample data, etc.):
    - Use official Docker client images (postgres, mysql, mongo) for direct connection
    - For K8s cluster databases: either port-forward + local access or temporary client pods
    - For multiple queries: consider keeping containers running and using docker exec, then cleanup
    - Choose appropriate client versions based on target database version
