- When you cannot implement the code immediately, explicitly indicate that it has not been implemented. For example, use `NotImplementedError` in Python or `TODO` in Kotlin. Do not hardcode to hide the problem.
- Create a todo list first when working on complex tasks to track progress and remain on track.
