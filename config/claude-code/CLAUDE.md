- When you cannot implement the code immediately, explicitly indicate that it has not been implemented. For example, use `NotImplementedError` in Python or `TODO` in Kotlin. Do not hardcode to hide the problem.
- Create a todo list first when working on complex tasks to track progress and remain on track.

- For database access tasks (schema analysis, sample data, etc.):
    - Use official Docker client images (postgres, mysql, mongo) for direct connection
    - For K8s cluster databases: either port-forward + local access or temporary client pods
    - For multiple queries: consider keeping containers running and using docker exec, then cleanup
    - Choose appropriate client versions based on target database version
- When completing a logical unit of work (e.g., finishing a TODO item, completing a feature without bugs), establish a checkpoint:
    - In manual mode: suggest to the user to create a git commit
    - In `auto-accept edits on` mode: proactively create a git commit with appropriate message
    - Consider a checkpoint complete when: a TODO is fully implemented, a feature works without errors, or a bug fix is verified
- When creating or editing a Github pull request (PR), write body in Korean and omit the "Test plan" section.
- Do not attempt to run the `sudo` command yourself; instead, ask the user to run it manually and wait for their result.
